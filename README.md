## Inspiration

Real world asset (RWA) tokenization marks a transformative paradigm shift in traditional finance by digitizing physical assets and representing them as blockchain-based tokens. This innovation enables fractional ownership, increased liquidity, and enhanced accessibility for investors.

## What is Houseform

Houseform is a platform to invest in real estate projects through fractional ownership.

Investors can participate in funding real world building projects and acquire fractional ownership through the purchase of tokenized shares. These shares, represented as NFTs on the blockchain, entitle investors to a percentage of the project value upon successful completion and sale.

## How it works

Projects are listed on Houseform with the corresponding data, like the amount of shares available, the goal amount or investment expected profit.

When investors decide to buy the tokenized shares of a project, they get an amount of KIP37 NFTs equal to the number of shares they bought. These shares represent the ownership of a fraction of the building and can be kept or traded in the open market.

When the project is completed and the building has been sold, project shares can be redeemed by burning the corresponding NFT and obtaining an amount based on how much profitable was the selling of the construction.

In the same way, builders can list projects, get funded to build/manage them and obtain a builder fee for the work done.
